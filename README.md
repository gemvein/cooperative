cooperative
===========

Cooperative is a Social Engine that provides the power of all the Social Networking mainstays for your Rails 4 apps.

Designed as a full-service Rails 4 Mountable Engine, Cooperative can have you up and running with a functional social networking website in minutes.

It uses devise for authentication, and incorporates a number of popular gems with a great deal of custom code, in order to provide the savvy developer with a head-start at developing any Social Web 2.0 application. Buzzwords?  We've got them all.

* Twitter Bootstrap provided by bootstrap-sass and souped up with bootswitch to swap out bootswatch themes.
* Statuses, Comments, Pages, Posts, and Tags
* Users, Follows, Groups, and Roles
* Votes, Ratings, and (soon) the resulting Recommendations based on Euclidean Distance and Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient
